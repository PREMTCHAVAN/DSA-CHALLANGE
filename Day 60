191. Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of 
set bits
it has (also known as the Hamming weight).



Example 1:

Input: n = 11
Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

Example 2:

Input: n = 128
Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:


        res = 0

        while n :

            n = n & ( n - 1 )   # sUB 1 from n , then n & (n - 1)
 
            res += 1            # Incrementing res counter after SUB 1


        return res
