//151. Reverse Words in a String

//Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
//A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
//Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
//Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

//code
