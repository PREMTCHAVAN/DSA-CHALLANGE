268. Missing Number

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.


code 

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return ( ( len(nums) * (len(nums) + 1) ) // 2 ) - sum(nums)









125. Valid Palindrome

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.
Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.





code


class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:

        act_s = ""

        for i in s :

            if i.isalnum() :

                act_s = act_s + i.lower()

        
        return act_s == act_s[ : : -1]
