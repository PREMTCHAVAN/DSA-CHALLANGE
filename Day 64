121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        

        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0


        for p in prices :

            if p < min_price :

                min_price = p

            elif p - min_price > max_profit :

                max_profit = p - min_price


        return max_profit
