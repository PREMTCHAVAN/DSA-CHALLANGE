136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

// code


class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        res = 0

        for i in nums :

            res ^= i 

        return res 



338. Counting Bits

Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.


// code 

class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        
        res = [0] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(1,n+1) :

            res[i] = res[i >> 1] + ( i & 1)

        
        return res
