371. Sum of Two Integers

Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two integers without using the operators + and -


Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

-1000 <= a, b <= 1000



code



class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:


        while b != 0:

            temp = (a & b) << 1  # Calculating Carry and shifting it

            a = a ^ b  # Calculating Result

            b = temp

        return a
