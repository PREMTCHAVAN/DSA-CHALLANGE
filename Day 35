You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:

Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

code 


class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:

        first_num = Second_num = 1

        if n == 1 :

            return n
      
        for i in range( n - 1 ) :

            Third_num = first_num + Second_num

            Second_num = first_num
            first_num = Third_num

        
        return Third_num
